I. Building the meta-lantronix BSP layer
========================================

This BSP is distributed as tar file containing the full Yocto build tree.
Here is the directory structure:

  yocto/
    build/
      conf/
        bblayers.conf
        local.conf
    sources/
      meta-lantronix/
      meta-openembedded/
      poky/

Note that the meta-lantronix layer, as well as the layers contained in
meta-openembedded and poky, are listed in yocto/build/conf/bblayers.conf.
Also, the MACHINE is set to "pw2050" in yocto/build/conf/local.conf.

First, make sure you have the Yocto host requirements installed.  The command
to install the dependencies is listed for all supported host distributions here:
http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.0/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html#packages

To build the BSP, first cd to the yocto/ directory, then run:

$ source sources/poky/oe-init-build-env build

This will set up the environment and move you to the build directory.  Now, run:

$ bitbake ltrx-image

When the build completes, the final image will be located at:
yocto/build/tmp/deploy/images/pw2050/premierwave_gg2050_ltrx-image_1.0.0.1R15.rom

This image can be flashed using Lantronix DeviceInstaller on Windows.

1) Copy premierwave_gg2050_ltrx-image_1.0.0.1R15.rom to a Windows host.
2) Install and run Lantronix DeviceInstaller
3) Connect the PW2050 to the host using the J9 Mini USB port.
4) Choose "Tools -> Recover Firmware" or press F8.
5) Select the .rom file as the firmware image.  Do not select a recovery loader firmware.
6) Follow the prompts.  When flashing is complete, you will be able to access
   the console on the J10 Mini USB port.
